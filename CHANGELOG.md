## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **The app could not start at all.** The logging config declared a rotating
  file handler writing to `logs/django.log`, but that directory is not in the
  repository and `dictConfig` opens every handler at configuration time. Every
  `manage.py` command failed with `ValueError: Unable to configure handler 'file'`.
  Logging is now console-only, which is also the right choice for containerised
  hosts with ephemeral disks.
- **No model could ever ship.** `.gitignore` excluded `*.json`, `*.parquet`,
  `*.npy`, `*.npz` and `*.pkl` repository-wide, so the "demo model" the README
  promised in `static/` was never committed. The ignore rules are now scoped to
  the `models/` output directories, and the docs describe the real setup.
- **Loading a model could exhaust memory.** The similarity matrix was densified
  with `.toarray()` on load -- about 10 GB for the documented 50,000-movie
  configuration. Sparse matrices now stay sparse and dense ones are
  memory-mapped, so only the row being queried is read.
- Genres never displayed: parquet list columns load as numpy arrays, so the
  `isinstance(value, list)` check discarded every genre. Affected the web app
  and `training/infer.py`.
- The year filter in `training/infer.py` read the last component of an ISO
  date, turning `1999-03-30` into the year `30`.
- `training/train.py` crashed on Windows consoles (cp1252) when printing emoji.
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` was enabled without `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, which
  causes an infinite redirect loop behind the TLS-terminating proxies used by
  Render and Heroku. `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` is now derived from the deployment
  hostname as well, which Django requires for HTTPS form posts.
- `/api/health/` returned 503 while the model was still loading, so a platform
  health check could kill a deploy before it finished starting. It now reports
  200 with `status: starting` during load and 503 only for a real failure.
- The health endpoint no longer echoes exception text or filesystem paths.
- Model-loading state was mutated from request threads without a lock, so
  concurrent first requests could each start their own loader thread.
- Google links are URL-encoded, so titles containing `&`, `?` or `#` work.
- Rating filters are NaN-safe.
- Poster artwork rendered *underneath* the placeholder icon, and the rank,
  match and rating badges underneath the artwork. The placeholder is absolutely
  positioned and positioned elements paint above static ones regardless of DOM
  order, so the layers needed explicit z-index values. Only visible once real
  poster images load.

### Changed
- The catalogue is no longer inlined into every page render. Autocomplete uses
  the existing (previously unused) `/api/search/` endpoint, so page weight is
  constant instead of growing with the number of movies.
- Recommendations use `np.argpartition` rather than sorting every movie.
- Title lookup tries exact, then prefix, then substring, and only falls back to
  fuzzy matching -- much faster and more predictable than running difflib over
  the whole catalogue on every request.
- `training/train.py` stores the top **K** neighbours per movie instead of the
  full N x N similarity matrix: roughly 20 MB rather than 10 GB at 50,000
  movies, computed in bounded-memory chunks. The old format is still readable,
  and `--legacy-matrix` still produces it.
- `training/train.py` has a real command-line interface (`--help`).
- MMR "diverse recommendations" re-ranks a shortlist instead of scoring every
  movie against every selection, which was quadratic and unusable at scale.
- Runtime and training dependencies are split (`requirements-train.txt`), and
  the unused ones -- Django REST Framework, django-cors-headers,
  django-extensions, redis, django-redis, python-decouple, fastparquet -- are
  gone. `nltk`, which `train.py` imports, was missing and is now declared.
- `SECRET_KEY` must be set explicitly when `DEBUG=False`; the app refuses to
  start with the development key in production.
- Gunicorn runs one worker with threads, so the model is held once per host.
- `PYTHON_VERSION` on Render raised to 3.12 (numpy 2.3 requires 3.11+).
- `static/logo.ico` reduced from 242 KB to 6.8 KB by keeping the 16/32/48 px
  frames instead of nine sizes up to 256x256. Same artwork -- the 48 px frame
  is pixel-identical to the original.
- Packaging recipes exclude `*.pkl`. The TF-IDF and SVD pickles are retraining
  artifacts that nothing loads at serving time, and they dominate the size: a
  1,200-movie model is 17.2 MB packaged, or 299 KB without them. `demo_model/`
  is also searched automatically, so committing a small model needs no
  configuration at all.

### Added
- A test suite (37 tests) covering model loading, matching, filtering, link
  encoding, the API endpoints, and the missing-model and error states.
- Posters on result cards, with a graceful fallback when artwork is missing.
- "Did you mean" suggestions are now rendered as clickable chips. The view had
  been computing them all along; the template never displayed them.
- A clear, actionable message when no model is installed, instead of a loading
  bar that never finished.
- `.env.example` documenting every supported environment variable.
- Custom 404 and 500 pages (`error.html` existed but was never wired up).
- Keyboard-accessible autocomplete (ARIA combobox), reduced-motion support, and
  no-JavaScript fallbacks so content is never left invisible.
- `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`. The README claimed Docker compatibility and
  the guide told you to copy a Dockerfile out of the documentation; that one
  pinned Python 3.10 (too old for numpy 2.3) and set `DEBUG=False` with no
  `SECRET_KEY`, so it could not have started. The ignore patterns use `**/`
  prefixes: Docker matches against the context root, so a bare `*.pkl` would
  have baked the 40 MB SVD pickle into the image (930 MB vs 852 MB).
- Optional `MODEL_URL` support in `render.yaml`: if set, the build downloads and
  unpacks a model archive into `MODEL_DIR`. Build-time only -- the app never
  fetches anything while serving.
- A GitHub Actions workflow running `check`, `check --deploy` and the test
  suite. The startup crash above is exactly the class of bug `manage.py check`
  catches and a test suite cannot, because settings have to load first.

cp -r static/ backup/
cp -r models/ backup/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Step 2: Update Code
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 3: Update Dependencies
```bash

source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate

# Update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

#### Step 4: Choose Model Option

**Option A: Use Demo Model (Quick)**
```bash
export MODEL_DIR=./static
```

**Option B: Train New Model (Recommended)**
```bash
# See training/guide.md for complete instructions
python training/train.py

# Use your trained model
export MODEL_DIR=./models
```

#### Step 5: Update Environment
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Test API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/
```

#### Step 8: Update Custom Code (if any)

If you modified the original code:

1. **Views**: Check `recommender/views.py` for new structure
2. **Templates**: Update to use new movie object fields
3. **URLs**: Update to use new API endpoints
4. **Settings**: Review `settings.py` for new configurations
